the spaces must also be included into the equation. Wihouth including spaces,
the message will not read correctly. In addition to the addition symbol. 
Javascript has codes for string to format the way a string are written.

\\          A printed backslash
\n          A new line will start
\r          Carriage return
\t          Indents the text

/* WITH STRING METHODS
When a string is assigned to a variable, string methods (preforming certain
duties) will change the value of a string. Since strings are an immutable value,
the original variable is not changed. The methods are already uploaded onto
JavaScripts' server and do not need to be declared. Some methods include:

Method                   Output
______________          _______________________________________________________
.slice()                Removed part of the string and returns a new string.
.split()                Splits a string and turns it into an array.
.toLowerCase()          Converts all uppercase letter in a string to lower case.
.toString()             Returns the valuse of a given string.
